# subGraphForRequestNetwork
A subgraph for request network that indexes multiple events such as the created, accepted and cancelled invoices.

This subgraph was used in the production of a Dapp for making payments at electric car charging stations with crypto.
You can view the dapp here : https://fervent-swanson-2ad1a3.netlify.com/

The subgraph provides the dapp a log of invoicing history that both end users and electric stations can use to keep track of electric purchase transactions which can be used filing taxes for both the user and the electric station owner.

#PAY WITH CRYTPO APP FOR ELECTRIC CAR CHARGING STATIONS This app is designed allow electric car owners and charging stations 
keep track of transaction costs over time by using request network smart contract to manage invoicing and the graph protocol 
to keep track of all invoicing activity such as the number of invoices created/accepted/created over a certain period of time.

Please not that Request network smart contract used is a FORK of the original request network code on the rinkeby network, with a minor change to a 
single line to allows easier access to the smart contract for the sake of demonstration purposes.
