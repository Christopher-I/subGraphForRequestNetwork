# subGraphForRequestNetwork
A subgraph for request network that indexes multiple events such as the created, accepted and cancelled invoices.

This subgraph was used in the production of a Dapp for making payments at electric car charging stations with crypto.
You can view the dapp here : https://fervent-swanson-2ad1a3.netlify.com/
Dapp Repository here: https://github.com/Christopher-I/ElectricChargingStation

The subgraph allows the dapp create a log of all invoicing history that both end users and electric stations can use to keep track of transcation and other purposes such as filing taxes.
It can also provide user-behaviour information for the electric charging station, such as - Since our last software update, how many invoices have been created and furthermore how many have been accepted. Such information can be used to improve user experience on the electric station platform.

#PAY WITH CRYTPO APP FOR ELECTRIC CAR CHARGING STATIONS This app is designed allow electric car owners and charging stations 
keep track of transactions costs over time by using request network protocol to manage invoicing and the graph protocol 
to keep track of all invoicing activity much as as the number of invoiced created.

Please not that Request network smart contract used is a FORK of the original request network code, with a minor change to a 
single line to allows easier access to the protocol for the sake of demonstration purposes.
