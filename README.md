#PAY WITH CRYTPO APP FOR ELECTRIC CAR CHARGING STATIONS This app is designed allow electric car owners and charging stations 
keep track of transactions costs over time by using request network protocol to manage invoicing and the graph protocol 
to keep track of all invoicing activity much as as the number of invoiced created.

Please not that Request network smart contract used is a FORK of the original request network code, with a minor change to a 
single line to allows easier access to the protocol for the sake of demonstration purposes.
